# Melanoma Detection using CNN VGG16

## Overview
This repository contains the code implementation for melanoma detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with VGG16 architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of skin lesion images to classify melanoma and non-melanoma lesions.

## Features
- Utilizes pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction
- Fine-tuned for melanoma detection
- Provides scripts for training, evaluation, and prediction

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of [provide details about your dataset, such as size, source, and any preprocessing steps].

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- [List any other dependencies or specific versions required]

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/melanoma-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Train the model:
   ```
   python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset --epochs 50
   ```
4. Evaluate the model:
   ```
   python evaluate.py --model /path/to/model --dataset /path/to/test/dataset
   ```
5. Make predictions:
   ```
   python predict.py --image /path/to/image.jpg --model /path/to/model
   ```
